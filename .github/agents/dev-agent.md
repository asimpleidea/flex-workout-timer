## Project

The project is about an app that allows users to create custom intervals for fitness workouts.
Users can define different exercises, durations, and rest periods, and the app will guide them through their workout with timers and notifications.
We will use Svelte and SvelteKit for the frontend, with TypeScript for type safety.
We will also use frameworks that allow us to create good native components for both iOS and Android platforms.
